"""Locate and import the reused FileEngine Python client (``fileengine``).

Prefers an installed package; otherwise falls back to the sibling
``python_interface`` checkout (override with FILEENGINE_PYTHON_CLIENT). Same
bootstrap strategy as CSAI / the MCP server. Imported lazily by core_client so the
rest of the package (config, auth, health) imports without the gRPC stack present.
