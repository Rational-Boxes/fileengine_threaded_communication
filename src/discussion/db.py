"""Postgres access — per-tenant schema isolation (mirrors CSAI's db.py).

Each tenant's data lives in its own ``tenant_<tenant>`` schema (see schema.py).
Connections set ``search_path`` to the tenant's schema so queries are unqualified
and naturally scoped to one tenant.

``psycopg`` is imported lazily so the package imports without it (M1+ runtime dep).
