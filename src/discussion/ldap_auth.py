"""LDAP authentication and role resolution — the auth/permission authority.

Mirrors CSAI / the FileEngine MCP server: a real bind authenticates the user,
roles come from group membership, and a tenant's ``administrators`` group maps to
the core's ``system_admin`` role. The resolved identity is forwarded to the gRPC
core, which enforces ACLs.
