"""Per-request credential resolution for the HTTP surface (mirrors CSAI).

Two credential paths, both ending at the same LDAP-derived identity:
  * ``Authorization: Basic <user:pass>``  → a live LDAP bind every request.
  * ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``     → our ``/auth/token`` token, or a bridge
    token verified via ``BridgeTokenVerifier``.

The tenant is per-session: ``X-Tenant`` header or a Host subdomain label, else the
configured default — independent of the user's LDAP entry.
