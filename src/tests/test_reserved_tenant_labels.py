"""The sign-in origin's label is never a tenant.

login.<base> also serves the workspace when a tenant's own subdomain is
unreachable, so its service paths are proxied there. A request on that host
without X-Tenant must not resolve to tenant "login": the core auto-registers
any tenant it is asked about, and download tickets, service tokens and Basic
service principals are not stopped by the session-token membership check.
