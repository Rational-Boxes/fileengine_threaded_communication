"""The revoked-token denylist reader (copied verbatim across services).

What is worth testing here is not that redis-py works, but the two decisions
this file makes on its own: that an unreachable denylist REFUSES rather than
waves the token through, and that the cache never turns "we could not ask" into
a lasting "yes". Both are easy to get quietly backwards, and both would fail
silently — the service would keep serving, exactly as it did before the fix.
